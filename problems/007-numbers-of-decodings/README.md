# Problem 007 â€“ Number of Decodings

**Problem:**

Given a mapping `a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26`, and an encoded message consisting of digits, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

**Example:**

Input: `"111"`  
Output: `3`

**Constraints:**

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, `"001"` is not allowed.
