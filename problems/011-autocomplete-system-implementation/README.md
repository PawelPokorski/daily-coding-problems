# Problem 011 – Autocomplete System Implementation

**Problem:**

Implement an autocomplete system. Given a query string `s` and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have `s` as a prefix.

**Example:**

Given the query string `de` and the set `[dog, deer, deal]`, return `[deer, deal]`.

**Constraints:**

Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
