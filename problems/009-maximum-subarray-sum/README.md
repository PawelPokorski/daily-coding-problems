# Problem 009 â€“ Maximum Subarray Sum

**Problem:**

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be `0` or negative.

**Examples:**

  1. `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return `13`, since we pick `2`, `6`, and `5`.
  2. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return `10`, since we pick `5` and `5`.

**Constraints:**

The algorithm should achieve O(N) time complexity and constant space complexity.
